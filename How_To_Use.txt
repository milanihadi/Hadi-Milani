
ðŸ”§ How to Use the EFDS Tool (Equal Friction Duct Sizing for AutoCAD)
Load the LISP Tool into AutoCAD
Open AutoCAD and type APPLOAD, then browse to and load   EFDS.fas.

Run the Tool
Type EFDS in the command line and press Enter.

Input Design Parameters via Dialog Box
A dialog window will open asking for:

Unit System: Choose IP (in, fpm, in.wg) or SI (mm, m/s, Pa)

Air Density (e.g., 0.075 lb/ftÂ³ or 1.2 kg/mÂ³)

Duct Roughness (e.g., 0.0003 ft or 0.9 mm)

Target Friction Loss (in.wg/100 ft or Pa/m)

Text settings (height, font, color)

Line settings (layer names, color, offset options)

Pick a Starting Point
Select a point on the first duct line in your network â€” this is where the flow will begin tracing.

Select All Duct Lines in the Network
When prompted, use a window or manual selection to select all lines (LINE or LWPOLYLINE) representing ducts.

Automatic Calculations and Annotations
The tool will:

Trace the flow from the starting point

Read FLOW RATE from connected diffuser blocks

Calculate:

Duct diameter (or rectangular width/height)

Velocity

Friction loss

Annotate the network directly on the drawing (text appears on duct lines)

Store full data (flow, velocity, diameter, dp, etc.) as XData on each line

Export Results to CSV (Optional)
To export the full flow data for all ducts, type the command:EX

Note: EFDS.prv is an auxiliary file automatically generated during compilation and is not required for using the tool.
